ABSTRACT					
The National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom (UK) is facing significant challenges in its Accident and Emergency (A&E) department, where patient waiting times are on the rise, and traditional solutions, such as increasing the number of staff, have not solved the issues effectively. Mathematical modelling, like the queueing model, has proven to be effective in operational management for tackling similar problems related to efficiency, resource allocation, and customer satisfaction-while these models provide a framework for understanding queue dynamics, calibrating them with data poses a challenge, and this is why this project aims to use data and mathematical analysis to lay the groundwork for the development of the queueing model.
Previous research by (Armony et al. 2015) has observed by eye three distinct queue regimes by just a graphical representation: increasing queue length during early morning hours, decreasing length in the afternoon, and stable length during intermediate hours. Therefore, this study will build upon this by developing an algorithm to automate a system that detects those regimes' presence in the A&E data alongside generating interesting statistics and parameters for developing a queueing model that is tailored for the A&E setting that will create a digital twin of current queueing dynamics, enabling resource managers to make informed decisions and implement effective strategies. This research offers a novel opportunity to address NHS challenges around A&E and lay the groundwork for the future development of a tailored queue model.
